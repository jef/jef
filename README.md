Some things you should know about life:

- [All open source maintainers (including me!) owe you nothing](https://mikemcquaid.com/2018/03/19/open-source-maintainers-owe-you-nothing/).
- Emailing open source maintainers (including me!) directly instead of opening issues on their project is a rude thing to do.
- There's [some things that good engineers do](https://mikemcquaid.com/2019/10/21/some-things-good-engineers-do/).
- Drive-by negativity is literally killing open source.
- You should [stop mentoring first-time contributors to open source projects](https://mikemcquaid.com/2019/02/16/stop-mentoring-first-time-contributors/).
- If you can't say something nice, maybe you shouldn't say anything at all.
- You should [contribute to open source every friday](https://github.blog/2017-06-27-contribute-on-open-source-friday/) (or, even better, every weekday).
